===============================
`avn` (Avian Vocalization Network, pronounced 'avian') is a python package for zebra finch song analysis. It currently provides
functions necessary for threshold-based syllable segmentation, syntax analysis for songs with user-provided syllable labels, and calculation of a suite of acoustic features based on `Sound Analysis Pro <http://soundanalysispro.com/>`_. For more information, 
please contact `Therese Koch <mailto:therese.koch@utsouthwestern.edu>`_ or consult
